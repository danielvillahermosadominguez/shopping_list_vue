- Now I'm with the first acceptance test. With the unit tests for the component Shopping List
- Also, we need to finish the integration test with the Apollo integration, so we will need to implement the App Service methods
- In addition, I suppose we need to create a little server of apollo which can work like a Fake
  - It could be interesting research if we could use wiremock or something like that for this.
  - The main idea is to work on the backend part, but with kotlin
- Detected bugs:
  - [BUG]The about and home, doesn't work properly
- Detected improvements:
  - Works in styles could be interesing. For example, the table, could need some lines.
